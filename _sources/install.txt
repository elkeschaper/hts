Installation
============


We recommend to install HTS in a [virtual environment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/).

With pip (or pip3) configured for Python3, you can install the latest version of HTS directly from Github::

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/elkeschaper/hts.git



Once HTS is available on Pypi, try::

    $ pip install hts




Now you can import hts in your Python3 project::

    import hts
